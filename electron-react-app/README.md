Electron WebView OSC Trigger
This project enables remote interaction with a webpage loaded inside an Electron <webview> using OSC (Open Sound Control) messages. It allows triggering clicks on elements (e.g., buttons, links) by id, class, or visible text â€” and optionally scopes those actions to a specific parent container.

ðŸ§© Architecture
Electron â€” loads the target website into a <webview>.
React â€” provides UI components (optional).
Preload script â€” bridges the Electron backend with the DOM in the webview.
OSC server â€” listens for incoming OSC messages and executes corresponding DOM actions.
ðŸ“¦ Installation
npm install
		
##ðŸ’¡ OSC Command Formats

OSC Address                            Example Action Description
/id/play-button                        Clicks the element with id="play-button"
/class/start-button                    Clicks all elements with class="start-button"
/text/all/Run                          Clicks all buttons with visible text Run
/all/text/Submit                       Same as above; both /text/all/... and /all/text/... are valid
/scoped/id/1234/text/Start             Clicks the Start button inside a container with id="1234"
/scoped/id/container123/class/action   Clicks all elements with .action class inside #container123

Development Notes
	â€¢	All behavior is controlled via the generateScriptFromOSC() function.
	â€¢	If no matching element is found, a warning is logged in the webview console.
	â€¢	The scoped mode allows targeting elements only inside a specific parent container by its ID.
